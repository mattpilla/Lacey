# Lacey
Built with [tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs)

Lacey is a personalized twitch bot, making this repo have very little value to anyone else. However, if you wish to use this bot (or build off of it):
- clone this repo
- `npm install`
- create `auth.json` (following the example file as a base)
- `node lacey`

## Commands
This bot literally does fucking nothing right now (except connect to specified channels and silently listen to everything you do). This section will always list everything the bot can do (including now).

## Terminal
Extra control using stdin where `lacey.js` is running
- `<message>`: Send a message to the home channel (first channel specified in `auth.json`) as Lacey
