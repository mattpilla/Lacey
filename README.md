Lacey is a personalized twitch bot, making this repo have very little value to anyone else. However, if you wish to use this bot (or build off of it):
- clone this repo
- `npm install`
- create `auth.json` (following the example file as a base)
- `node lacey`

## Commands
- `hey`: Greets you! : )

## Terminal
Extra control using stdin where `lacey.js` is running
- `<message>`: Send a message to the home channel (first channel specified in `auth.json`) as Lacey
